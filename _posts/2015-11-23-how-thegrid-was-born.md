_"If people knew how hard I worked to achieve my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful after all."-- **Michelangelo**_

I had just finished the website for a small janitorial company in Texas as Dan obsessed in photoshop over a flyer he was making to pass out in our local downtown shops.  He had been working on making a small 3d object appear when you held it up to a computer camera and I remember rolling my eyes multiple times at his relentlessness. As we 

Living in a foreclosing home in Healdsburg, CA, we were wondering what would become of us and our tiny web design company.  I dont remember feeling worried, as he had always provided for me in our 2 years of marriage and things always seemed to work out, although we had been living over 9 months off of food and coffee barters with other local business owners in exchange for website design.  One morning as he was on his computer I had found a documentary on Netflix called _Helvetica, _and told him he had to check it out.  The movie was about the most used font typeface ever created.  He was hooked.  He took note of the designer of Helvetica, Massimo Vignelli and ordered a dozen books on typeface design from Amazon and immersed himself in the new realization that design was actually a study of rules. Through this one typeface, he discovered that aesthetics could be mathematically calculated, which would later lay the foundation for so much more...

A few days later, Dan and I had been helping Dan's dad, Daniele on his blog site that was created in Wordpress. I had learned the basics of Wordpress- and was proficient in the basics, enough so that I was able to .  This was a new template he was using and I was showing him how to navigate the backend of his site. The interesting part of his site was that each post he published would show up as a rectangular shaped tile.  There was very little order to how these tiles would line up and there were so many unnecessary settings and buttons you needed to click on to just get it to post properly to the website. I became frustrated with the time it took to perform such a seemingly simple task.  I sat down and asked Dan why he thought there wasnt a way to build a website in which you could enter in content and it would just create it without the user having to do anything.  This posed an overarching question to all of the work we were doing.  It created a new 

It was the down of the Facebook Era, even our grandmothers had starting their own Facebook pages... and it was with this question that made us see that we were giving our own content away to build Facebooks website piece by piece.  We were giving them our photos, our thoughts, sharing who we were, giving them our information and getting nothing in return. 

Concurrently, companies were investing thousands of dollars on having a designer create a website for their company...and some of the more ambitious small business owners were creating their own in their free time.  This has left the internet contaminated with webpages that are barely functioning and not properly represented businesses.  We decided that we would make it our ultimate goal to not build custom websites ever again, and that we would figure out how to create an artificial intelligence to conquer the task.  With his background in physics and computer science, this was some such fun and games to Dan, so I sat back and watched him start making it become a reality. He started writing algorithms to make pixels abide to new rules, and began researching the best of the best programmers in the world to come work with him.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c723e17e-6f32-41fe-b40e-615e7f1debbe.jpg)

After the idea really started taking off, we realized how much it would take to get it right, to get it perfect, to deliver the promise we had made to ourselves and to the world... that the website problem could and would be solved.  That there was hope for each and every individual to create a new value for themselves on the internet, and have ownership over the real estate they were creating.  It is now almost a decade later from where we first started and
