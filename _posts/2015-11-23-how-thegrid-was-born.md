I had just finished the website for a small janitorial company in Texas as Dan obsessed in photoshop over a flyer he was making to pass out in our local downtown shops.  He had been working on making a small 3d object appear when you held it up to a computer camera and I remember rolling my eyes multiple times at his relentlessness. As we plugged in day after day, frusterated with communicating with clients who had no experience and very little solid vision for their site, we became cynical toward the disconnect and would regularly talk about how there must be a better way to publish on the internet.

Living in a sold home in Healdsburg, CA, we were wondering what would become of us and our tiny web design company, as we had only a couple of months to make our next move as a company of 2, and as a family.  I dont remember feeling worried, as he had always provided in our 2 years of marriage and things always seemed to work out... although this time felt different. We had been living in the little town for just over 6 months off of food and coffee barters with a couple of local business owners in exchange for website design.  One morning as he was on his computer I had found a documentary on Netflix called_Helvetica,_and told him he had to check it out. The movie was about the most used font typeface ever created.  He was hooked.  He took note of Massimo Vignelli, the genius behind the design of helvetica and ordered a dozen books on typeface design from Amazon and immersed himself in the new realization that design was actually a study of rules.  I think once he mentioned that if we ever had a daughter, that he wanted to name her "Helvetica"... although I strongly objected to that idea Through this one typeface, he discovered that aesthetics could be mathematically calculated, which would later lay the foundation for so much more...

A few days later, Dan and I had been helping Dan's dad, Daniele on [his blog][0] site that was created in Wordpress. I had learned the basics of Wordpress- and was proficient in the basics, enough so that I was able to .  This was a new template he was using and I was showing him how to navigate the backend of his site. The interesting part of his site was that each post he published would show up as a rectangular shaped tile.  There was very little order to how these tiles would line up and there were so many unnecessary settings and buttons you needed to click on to just get it to post properly to the website. I became frustrated with the time it took to perform such a seemingly simple task.  I sat down and asked Dan why he thought there wasnt a way to build a website in which you could enter in content and it would just create it without the user having to do anything.  This posed an overarching question to all of the work we were doing.  It created a new 

It was the early peak of the Facebook Era, even our grandmothers had starting their own Facebook pages... and it was with this question that made us see that we were giving our own content away to build Facebooks website piece by piece.  We were giving them our photos, our thoughts, sharing who we were, giving them our information and getting nothing in return. Companies large and small were creating Facebook Business Pages and entering their information with the motivation to get "likes" and yet they still were lacking what a website did for them.

Concurrently, some of the same companies were investing thousands of dollars on having a designer create a website for their company...and some of the more ambitious small business owners were attempting to build their own in their free time.  This left the internet contaminated with webpages that are barely functioning and not properly representing what their owners had in mind.  We decided that we would make it our ultimate goal to not build custom websites ever again, and that we would figure out how to create an artificial intelligence to conquer the task.  With his background in physics and computer science, this was some such fun and games to Dan, so I sat back and watched him start making it become a reality.

After the idea really started taking off, we realized how much it would take to get it right- to get it perfect.  Dan started writing algorithms to make pixels abide to new rules, and began researching the best of the best programmers in the world and taking note of their names. We raised some money from family and friends to start the venture which has now become TheGrid.  We moved to San Francisco with one employee, a college friend of Dans, and had a live-work set-up in Pacific Heights.  We had an ex-googler Brian Axe helping to set goals and keep Dan organized while Dan and his dad kept funds rolling in.  The project really came to life after an early facebook offer that Dan declined, which led to the loss of his two employees, who wanted the buyout and were realized that Dan's vision exceeded their own.  By then, Dan had contacted
